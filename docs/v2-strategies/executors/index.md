**Executors** in Hummingbot are self-managing components that handle the execution of orders according to predefined conditions. Executors are tasked with managing the state of orders â€” initiating, refreshing, and canceling orders, as well as halting their own operation when certain conditions are met.

## Background / Motivation

Before having Executors, you had to build the management of your position into the strategy code. This has two drawbacks: first, it makes that code more complicated as decision logic and managing the execution is mixed, and second, you have to code things like limit exits, trailing stops, etc. over and over again (cannot be reused).

This is where executors come into play. They encapsulate the logic of managing a position a certain way, the most simple one being the [Position Executor](positionexecutor.md), that basically opens a position and adds a take profit (either fixed or trailing) and a stop-loss (price and time-based possible).

That is reusable logic that you never have to code yourself and can purely focus on the signals (so when to enter or exit). Of course, more advanced executors like the [DCA Executor](dcaexecutor.md) offer a lot more than that.

## **Types of Executors**

* [Position Executor](positionexecutor.md)
* [DCA Executor](dcaexecutor.md)
* [Arbitrage Executor](arbitrage-executor.md)
* [TWAP Executor](twapexecutor.md)

## **Benefits of Executors**

* Autonomy: Executors independently manage order states, offloading complex logic from the user.
* Simplicity: They simplify strategy code, enabling users to create powerful strategies with ease.
* Flexibility: By dynamically adjusting to market data, Executors can set spreads and shift prices, offering greater strategy adaptability.


## **Executor Orchestrator**

The **ExecutorOrchestrator** serves as a utility class that enables trading strategies to dynamically create, stop, and manage executors, which are specialized units responsible for executing trading activities such as placing and managing orders. 

### Key Features and Operations

- **Initialization**: The `ExecutorOrchestrator` is initialized with a reference to the trading strategy (`strategy`) and an update interval (`executors_update_interval`). This setup allows it to periodically update and manage executors based on the strategy's requirements.

- **Executor Management**: It maintains a dictionary of executors, where each executor is associated with a controller ID. This structure facilitates the organization and retrieval of executors for management purposes.

- **Action Execution**: The orchestrator can execute various actions (`ExecutorAction`) such as creating, stopping, and storing executors. Actions are processed either individually or in batches, allowing for flexible execution management.

    * **Creating Executors**: Based on the `CreateExecutorAction`, it can instantiate different types of executors (e.g., `PositionExecutor`, `DCAExecutor`, `ArbitrageExecutor`) with specific configurations. This allows strategies to deploy diverse trading tactics dynamically.

    * **Stopping Executors**: Using the `StopExecutorAction`, it can gracefully stop executors, ensuring that any ongoing operations are properly concluded before termination.

    * **Storing Executors**: The `StoreExecutorAction` enables the orchestrator to store executor data, facilitating persistence and analysis of executor performance over time.

- **Performance Reporting**: The orchestrator can generate detailed performance reports for individual controllers or globally across all controllers. These reports include metrics such as realized and unrealized P&L (Profit and Loss), trading volume, and the distribution of close types, providing insights into the effectiveness of the trading strategy and its executors.
