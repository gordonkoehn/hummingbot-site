## XRPL Python Connector

This PR enhances the current **XRPL** API connector by transitioning it to a fully Python-based implementation, eliminating the need for the **Hummingbot Gateway**. Users can now utilize the XRPL connector similarly to a standard CEX connector by executing the `connect XRPL` command. This upgrade significantly boosts the connector's performance and enhances stability for user trading activities.
