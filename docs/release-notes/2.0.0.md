## Hummingbot 2.0 Highlights

### Deploy Repo

[Hummingbot Deploy](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy) is a dedicated repo that allows users to quickly deploy Hummingbot using the Dashboard as the front end UI. The compose file spins up containers for the [Dashboard](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard), [Backend-API](https://github.com/hummingbot/backend-api) as well as the **Hummingbot Broker**.

## New XRPL Connector (Python)

This PR enhances the current **XRPL** API connector by transitioning it to a fully Python-based implementation, eliminating the need for the **Hummingbot Gateway**. Users can now utilize the XRPL connector similarly to a standard CEX connector by executing the `connect XRPL` command. This upgrade significantly boosts the connector's performance and enhances stability for user trading activities.
